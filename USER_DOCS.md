# Build your own Lab remix

This documentation will guide you through making your own web application using the toolset provided by the JupyterLab plugin system and JupyterLab UI components.

## Structure of a Lab remix

Like any other web application, one built using JupyterLab components requires you implement both a backend and a frontend. The backend serves all the frontend assets to the user (HTML, CSS and JavaScript code, images, data etc) by implementing the HTTP endpoints. The frontend is made of the JavaScript code that runs in the user's browser to make dynamic pages.

It is advised to look at existing Lab remixes implementations and examples. You can find multiple examples of custom web applications using JupyterLab components under [the examples directory of the JupyterLab repo](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/master/examples). These are good starting points for making simple apps. You can also look at the [jupyterlab-app-template repository](https://github.com/jtpio/jupyterlab-app-template) which provides a template for starting a more advanced application, with everything setup for packaging your application.

### Server - backend

In order to implement the server application (in Python), you just need to subclass the `jupyterlab_server.LabServerApp` class. This class will provide everything for starting the web app from Python, this is where you will setup the right handlers for the different HTTP endpoints.

In the following example, we create a custom Lab application with a single handler for the `http://localhost:8888/custom` endpoint, which is the main entry for our application.

Let's put the following content in our `main.py` file:

```python
import os

import tornado

from jupyter_server.utils import url_path_join as ujoin
from jupyter_server.base.handlers import JupyterHandler
from jupyter_server.extension.handler import (
    ExtensionHandlerMixin,
    ExtensionHandlerJinjaMixin
)

from jupyterlab_server import LabServerApp

HERE = os.path.dirname(__file__)

version = '0.1.0'

def _jupyter_server_extension_points():
    return [
        {
            'module': __name__,
            'app': CustomApp
        }
    ]


class CustomHandler(
    ExtensionHandlerJinjaMixin,
    ExtensionHandlerMixin,
    JupyterHandler
    ):
    """Main handler for our application."""

    @tornado.web.authenticated
    def get(self):
        """Implement the HTTP GET request.
        In this case get the main page for the application's interface.
        """
        config_data = {
            # Use camelCase here, since that's what the lab components expect
            "appVersion": version,
            'baseUrl': self.base_url,
            'token': self.settings['token'],
            'fullStaticUrl': ujoin(self.base_url, 'static', self.name),
            'frontendUrl': ujoin(self.base_url, 'custom/'),
        }
        # Render the main template with Jinja
        return self.write(
            self.render_template(
                'index.html',
                static=self.static_url,
                base_url=self.base_url,
                token=self.settings['token'],
                page_config=config_data
                )
            )


class CustomApp(LabServerApp):
    """You custom Lab remix application."""

    name = __name__
    app_name = 'JupyterLab Custom App'
    app_version = version

    # Main endpoint to your application (where index.html will be served)
    extension_url = '/custom'

    # This is the default URL that the user is redirected
    # to when arriving on the web app
    default_url = '/custom'

    # Whether or not to load the other JupyterLab extensions
    load_other_extensions = False

    # Directory that contains the static assets (index.html, CSS, images etc)
    static_dir = os.path.join(HERE, 'build')
    app_settings_dir = os.path.join(HERE, 'build', 'application_settings')
    schemas_dir = os.path.join(HERE, 'build', 'schemas')
    templates_dir = os.path.join(HERE, 'templates')
    themes_dir = os.path.join(HERE, 'build', 'themes')
    user_settings_dir = os.path.join(HERE, 'build', 'user_settings')
    workspaces_dir = os.path.join(HERE, 'build', 'workspaces')

    def initialize_handlers(self):
        """Add custom handler to Lab Server's handler list.

        Handlers is a list of tuples (endpoint, handler_cls)
        """
        self.handlers.append(
            ('/custom', CustomHandler)
        )

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Launch the server application
    CustomApp.launch_instance()
```

You can now start your lab extension running `python main.py` from your terminal (this will not work until we have a proper frontend to serve):

```

    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://localhost:8888/custom?token=a59dee2ea49885c518515071ab058de33e725b4c73dbb890
